Device Studio User Guide
**************************************

**Welcome to Device Studio**. Device Studio is free for academic use. This tutorial provides detailed instructions for the **Windows version** of Device Studio.

Device_ Studio_ (DS for short) is a multi-scale materials design and simulation platform developed by Hongzhiwei Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. It enables **atomic-level material modeling (million-scale)**, **high-performance scientific simulation computing**, **computation task monitoring and management**, and **data visualization** analysis in an integrated workflow. This integration of material design and scientific simulation significantly enhances research efficiency and helps researchers address important challenges in multi-scale materials design and simulation.

Device_ Studio_ integrates various scientific computing software to meet users' simulation needs across different fields. It includes DS_-PAW_ for first-principles plane-wave calculations, BDF_ for quantum chemistry calculations.

Based on its powerful material design modeling and high-performance scientific simulation capabilities, Device_ Studio_ can be widely applied in quantum devices, artificial biology, advanced batteries, intelligent lighting, memory devices, and other industries. It assists in material research and development in electronic materials, alloys, biotechnology, and other fields, providing professional technical support for optoelectronics and integrated circuits industries.
